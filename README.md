A library to warm up website caches of URLs located in XML sitemaps. It is
written in PHP and was first released back in 2020.

Cache warmup is performed by concurrently sending simple HEAD requests to those
URLs, either from the command line or by using the provided PHP API. The whole
warmup process is highly customizable, e.g. by defining a crawling limit,
excluding sitemaps and URLs by exclusion patterns or by using a specific crawling
strategy. It is even possible to write custom crawlers that take care of cache warmup.

* Console command and PHP API for cache warmup
